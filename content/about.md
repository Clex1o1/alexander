# A quick summary about me.

Maybe you already read: my name is Alexander Classen and I'm a
passionate fullstack developer from Germany. I'm working at the agency
[Westwerk](https://www.westwerk.ac) in
Aachen, Germany.

My focus constantly shifts depending on the demands of the team or
project, or the trends I am currently pursuing. My strength lies
primarily in the frontend, although I also have a grasp of everything
(more or less) from backend to operations. Currently, I hold a
management role in our team, where I work on finding the right
technology for projects and planning our resources. This could involve
LEAN approaches to quickly implement a project with everything necessary
at a specific time, or addressing scalability issues. Most importantly,
I value that we all enjoy our work, are challenged, and can take pride
in our projects. When I'm not at the computer working on a project or
evaluating a side project, I like to go out, run, hike, climb, or make
music. I have a penchant for everything extraordinary and appreciate
good music and drinks.
