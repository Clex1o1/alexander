# The Great, huh?

I know it's a huge title...

Let me explain: If you know my name and the domain and naming problem
everybody has, you might understand why I chose it. Also, I have a new
email address: alexander@the-great.dev. How cool is that? It could mean
'Alexander the Great' or 'Alexander the Great Developer,' which would
imply that I'm great? Well, I'm not. I'm just another developer and tech
guy who starts late in the blog game. It could also stand for just 'The
Great' - singular or plural, depending on the technologies, programming
languages, frameworks, and people I will mention. That fits best!

## Sooo... Back to <s>the Future</s> basics

Hi! I'm Alexander Classen, a passionate full-stack developer from Germany,
and this is my journey. The journey starts now. Fasten your seat belts and
enjoy the ride!
