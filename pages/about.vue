      <p class="mt-4">
        Maybe you already read: my name is Alexander Classen and I'm a
        passionate fullstack developer from Germany. I'm working at the agency
        <a href="https://www.westwerk.ac" target="_blank">Westwerk</a> in
        Aachen, Germany.

        My focus constantly shifts depending on the demands of the team or
        project, or the trends I am currently pursuing. My strength lies
        primarily in the frontend, although I also have a grasp of everything
        (more or less) from backend to operations. Currently, I hold a
        management role in our team, where I work on finding the right
        technology for projects and planning our resources. This could involve
        LEAN approaches to quickly implement a project with everything necessary
        at a specific time, or addressing scalability issues. Most importantly,
        I value that we all enjoy our work, are challenged, and can take pride
        in our projects. When I'm not at the computer working on a project or
        evaluating a side project, I like to go out, run, hike, climb, or make
        music. I have a penchant for everything extraordinary and appreciate
        good music and drinks.

        Now, with over 10 years of experience, I'm specialized in TypeScript,
        Vue.js, Nuxt.js, TailwindCSS and Nest.js. I'm able to build nearly every
        kind of application based on these technologies. In my career I build:
        -multi tenancy applications -design systems and component libraries -web
        apps -webshops and ecommerce projects -coorparate websites My strength
        definitly is the frontend. I might have the eye for design and UX and
        can go the extra mile to create the most beautifull and user friendly
        interfaces. As I mentioned I'm able to create scalable and maintainable
        component libraries. In my experience the best pattern for this is based
        on the atomic design pattern. I extended this pattern with my own rules.
        You can read more about it in my later blogpost. Based on the concepts
        of isolated components by the atomic design I also like to design my
        backend applications. To archive this I bet on event driven
        architectures. All in all the most important thing for me is to build
        beautifull applications the users and I like. Applications I can
        identify myself with. I like to refactor, improve my code to fix my own
        mistakes and go the extra mile to the best solution and product. The
        biggest problem is my own claim and the challenge to find an end in the
        endless circle of refactoring and improving and new possibilities the
        web ecosystem offers. I will always try to make it a better an more
        generic solution. But I'm not a perfectionist. Some of my learnings: -
        the frist working solution can be shipped, it's more important to ship
        something rather than solve eventual problems you can imagine - don't be
        scared about refactoring, the requirements may change and you the
        current solution might not fit anymore - you should not be scared about
        deployments, automate everything to makes deployments as easy as
        possible, so you can deploy multiple times a day without breaking
        something - it's okay to copy your code, copying your code 2, 3 times is
        totally fine before create abstractions. ## Some additional abilities
        Every developer need to ask himself: how will progamm be shipped to the
        customer? With this question in mind I learned a lot about devops and
        deployment strategies. I'm able to setup a CI/CD pipelines, do server
        administraion and manage infrastructure. I have some basic knowledge
        about docker, ansible, linux, swarm and kubernetes. ## Soft skills As
        you might know, the web ecosystem is huge and i have long list of
        technologies i'm working with. I will start from top to bottom. ## Last
        but not least special interesst in learning: event sourcing, CQRS and
        DDD. Rust and Elixir
