      <h2 class="font-headline font-bold">My Journey in Development</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Embarking as a PHP developer during version 5.3, my journey evolved to
        spotlight the frontend and JavaScript. Since 2019, TypeScript has become
        my primary language, showcasing proficiency in:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Vue JS</li>
        <li>Nuxt JS</li>
        <li>Nest JS</li>
        <li>Directus</li>
        <li>Strapi</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Initiating projects involves leveraging backend solutions like Directus
        to swiftly prototype. The initial phase focuses on essentials, aided by
        frameworks like PrimeVue and Tailwind for speed. For more maintainable
        versions, I opt for NestJS and an event-driven system. Project-specific
        technologies include Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB, REST, CQRS, or GraphQL.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years of experience offer insights into various programming realms,
        necessitating a full-stack approach in agency work. This encompasses
        CI/CD, server administration, DNS, and routing. I prefer Docker-based
        hosting, steering clear of direct deployment on Kubernetes or cloud
        platforms for smaller scales, though some projects are hosted on cloud
        providers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Venturing into cross-platform frameworks, I've utilized Tauri for
        FastTrack and Capacitor for smartphone porting in projects like Catch.
        Additionally, I have a keen interest in Flutter for future mobile
        projects.
      </p>

      <p>Notably, two programming languages have captured my interest:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Rust</li>
        <li>Elixir</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Exposure to Rust began with solving Advent of Code 2022 tasks. Also,
        working with the Tauri backend in Rust broadened my understanding.
        Elixir's functional programming concept has captivated me, though my
        knowledge is basic. Future projects in both languages aim to enhance my
        expertise.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-headline font-bold mt-4">Specialization and Learnings</h2>

      <p>
        With over a decade of experience, I specialize in TypeScript, Vue.js,
        Nuxt.js, TailwindCSS, and Nest.js. My capabilities span various
        applications, including multi-tenancy applications, design systems, web
        apps, webshops, and corporate websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frontend development is my forte, combining an eye for design and UX to
        create beautiful and user-friendly interfaces. I excel in crafting
        scalable and maintainable component libraries, following the atomic
        design pattern with my own extensions. My backend design aligns with the
        atomic design's isolated component concept, implemented through
        event-driven architectures.
      </p>

      <p>
        My focus is on building applications that resonate with users and
        myself. While I enjoy refactoring and improving code, I recognize the
        challenge of finding an endpoint in the endless cycle of enhancement and
        new possibilities within the web ecosystem. I strive for better and more
        generic solutions without succumbing to perfectionism.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-headline font-bold mt-4">Key Learnings</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Ship the first working solution; it's crucial to deliver rather than
          solving hypothetical problems.
        </li>
        <li>Embrace refactoring as requirements evolve.</li>
        <li>
          Fear not deployments; automate processes to facilitate multiple daily
          deployments without breaking functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copying code a few times before creating abstractions is acceptable.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="font-headline font-bold mt-4">Additional Abilities</h2>

      <p>
        Considering the end-user experience, I've delved into devOps and
        deployment strategies. Proficient in setting up CI/CD pipelines,
        performing server administration, and managing infrastructure, I possess
        basic knowledge of Docker, Ansible, Linux, Swarm, and Kubernetes.
