      Let me explain: If you know my name and the domain and naming problem
      everybody has, you might understand why I chose it. Also, I have a new
      email address: alexander@the-great.dev. How cool is that? It could mean
      'Alexander the Great' or 'Alexander the Great Developer,' which would
      imply that I'm great? Well, I'm not. I'm just another developer and tech
      guy who starts late in the blog game. It could also stand for just 'The
      Great' - singular or plural, depending on the technologies, programming
      languages, frameworks, and people I will mention. That fits best!
